## Introduction
Python is a high-level, general purpose programming language. It promotes simplicity and code readability.

## Installation

If you get a version number it is installed, otherwise you will get a command not found error. In case it is not installed by default you can install it using your package manager:
1. On Arch linux: ```sudo pacman -S python```
1. On Debian based distros: ```sudo apt-get install python3```
1. On RHEL : ```sudo dnf install python3 ```
